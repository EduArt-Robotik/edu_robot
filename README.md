# edu_robot - Control Software for IoT Shield and Ethernet Gateway

Welcome to the EduArt ROS2 robot control software. In first place it provides a ROS2 node for controlling and monitoring EduArt robots, i.e., the robot Eduard in different hardware realizations like the IoT Bot, the IPC Bot or a custom build robot relying on our stackable drive system. There is also a [digital twin](https://github.com/EduArt-Robotik/edu_simulation) in the making, which is not yet feature complete. But, some basic interfaces are already implemented.

These packages are also designed for being used in a robot fleet setup. Basically, they are able to handle multiple robot instances at the same time while using namespaces.

# EduArt's Robot - Eduard

Eduard comes in two hardware realizations. Both using this control software. Below you will find documentation about how to install, update, control and monitor the robot.

# Controlling the Robot

## Controller

With the package [edu_robot_control](https://github.com/EduArt-Robotik/edu_robot_control) the EduArt's robots can be controlled remotely. The basic information about how to set up the joystick is also listed below. 

> **Note**: the package "edu_robot_control" don't need to be deployed extra. It is included in the "edu_robot" deployment.

A controller can be requested to connect by pressing a specific button once. For the recommended controllers, it is the symbol between the axes. To operate the Robot, the following buttons and axes of the controller are assigned as follows:


| Axis  | DS5                       | Idle position | Value range | function          | 
|-------|---------------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|

## Node Red

We have a Node Red Web Server, which can also be deployed as a Docker container. With this it is possible to use Topic, Services and Actions to control the robot. For more information please use the following link:

# Monitoring Eduard using ROS Tools

## RViz2

With the package [edu_robot_control](https://github.com/EduArt-Robotik/edu_robot_control) the EduArt's robots can be monitored using the tool RViz2 coming with ROS2.

For visualization of Eduard's sensors and actors a RViz setup is provided including a robot description. Since Eduard ROS control node publish all of Eduard's states via TF and ROS topic/services it is easy to access them.

The best way to monitor Eduard's states is using RViz. In the package "edu_robot_control" a launch file is provided including a RViz configuration that allows an easy and fast start. Two ways are supported.

### Native ROS2 Installation

If ROS is natively installed the "edu_robot_control" package can be installed into an ROS workspace. As first step clone the package into the workspace by:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EduArt-Robotik/edu_robot_control.git
```

Please make sure the package will be cloned into the "src" folder in the workspace. If no knowledge about ROS is present please see [docs.ros.org](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Creating-A-Workspace/Creating-A-Workspace.html) for further information. 

After the package was cloned it needs to be installed. First leave the "src" folder:

```bash
cd ..
```

Then build it by:

```bash
colcon build --packages-select edu_robot_control --symlink-install
```

Now RViz with the correct configuration can be launched. But before, the used namespace of the robot needs to be estimated. This can be done by:

```bash
ros2 topic list
```

This prints a list of all topics of your robot Eduard:

```bash
/eduard/blue/cmd_vel
/eduard/blue/imu
/eduard/blue/joy
/eduard/blue/joy/set_feedback
/eduard/blue/odometry
/eduard/blue/range/front/left/range
/eduard/blue/range/front/right/range
/eduard/blue/range/rear/left/range
/eduard/blue/range/rear/right/range
/eduard/blue/robot_kinematic_description
/eduard/blue/set_lighting_color
/eduard/blue/set_motor_rpm
/eduard/blue/status_report
```

The namespace is a prefix used by the topic names. In this case it is "eduard/blue".

#### Important: Setting Correct Namespace

Each Eduard robot comes with a preset namespace, e.g. to reflect the robot's color. This allows that multiple robots are connected to the same network (with same DOMAIN_ID). However this makes it necessary to deal with the namespace, too, when the robot's data shall be received. For example when displaying data using RViz2.

> Note: when a namespace is used the **Fixed Frame** has to be reselected, otherwise the robot is not displayed correctly.

The namespace can be set by using an environment variable. Either set it via the system or define it in front of the ros command:

```bash
EDU_ROBOT_NAMESPACE=eduard/red ros2 launch edu_robot_control eduard_monitor.launch.py
```

This this case it was set to **eduard/red**. Please replace the color accordingly to your robot. RViz will respect the color and will coloring the robot model. At the moment three colors are available:

![eduard-red](documentation/image/eduard-red.png)![eduard-green](documentation/image/eduard-green.png)![eduard-blue](documentation/image/eduard-blue.png)

#### Select Wheel Type

Eduard comes with two types of wheel. If wanted it can be selected in RViz for a correct visualization by setting a environment variable in front of the ros command:

```bash
EDU_ROBOT_WHEEL_TYPE=offroad ros2 launch edu_robot_control eduard_monitor.launch.py
```

The following two wheel types are available: mecanum and offroad

![eduard-mecanum](documentation/image/eduard-red-mecanum.png)![eduard-offroad](documentation/image/eduard-red-offroad.png)


### Trouble Shooting

#### No module named 'roslaunch'

If the following error raises at the launch:

```bash
[ERROR] [launch]: Caught exception in launch (see debug for traceback): substitution args not supported:  No module named 'roslaunch'
```

Please make sure that the correct 'xacro' is installed. For example for ROS humble install 'ros-humble-xacro'.

## rqt robot monitor

The Eduard control software provides a diagnostic aggregation. With this, the status of major components can be displayed, as well as live characteristics of these.

With the standard tool **rqt_robot_monitor** this diagnostic aggregation can be displayed. The application can be started by:

```bash
ros2 run rqt_robot_monitor rqt_robot_monitor
```

Following window will open. Errors and warnings will be shown on the both top lists. By double click on an entry a more detailed windows will open.

![error-case](documentation/image/diagnostic-error-case-2.png)

 If you want to see the **OK** states, too, then press on the check box **Alternative view** on the top left corner.

 ![good-case](documentation/image/diagnostic-good-case.png)


## Safety instructions

Read this document carefully before using the product for the first time and make sure that no safety-related questions remain unanswered.
