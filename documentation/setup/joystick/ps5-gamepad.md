# Setting up your PS5 Gamepad

A joystick can be used to operate Eduard. For this purpose, the robot must be extended by a Debian-compatible Bluetooth stick. PlayStation&reg; 4 and PlayStation&reg; 5 controllers were used, which are interpreted identically in their operating interface. The initial start-up of a Bluetooth controller follows.

Start the Bluetooth controller in the operating system:

```console
$ bluetoothctl
```

Set up the controller and prepare for scanning:

```console
$ agent on 
$ default-agent 
$ power on 
$ discoverable on 
$ pairable on
```

Put the PlayStation&reg; Controller into connection mode by pressing the Share and PS buttons simultaneously. 
Rapid flashing indicates the status.

Now start the scanning process:

```console
$ scan on
```

The connection process so far should look like this. Your joystick is now recognized as a wireless controller. Copy the MAC address of the device for the rest of the procedure.

Connect the controller using the following commands and its MAC address. If needed, press the PlayStation button again when the light signals stop flashing.

```console
$ pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX 
$ trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX 
$ connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
$ exit 
```

 > **Note**: These steps are only required once at the very beginning. From now on, when the PS button is pressed, the joystick should automatically connect to the IOT2050 once it has successfully booted up. These operations are only then necessary again if the controller has been connected to another device in the meantime.
